# STORY-01-DATABASE-STRUCTURE: Initial Database Structure Design

## User Story
As a system architect, I want to establish the initial database structure for users, stores, and roles so that the platform can support multi-store operations with proper user management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User table with essential fields (id, email, password, name, created_at, updated_at)
- [ ] Store table with store information (id, name, description, owner_id, status, created_at, updated_at)
- [ ] Role table for system roles (id, name, description, permissions)
- [ ] User-Store relationship table for store assignments (user_id, store_id, role_id)
- [ ] Database migrations are created and can be executed
- [ ] Database indexes are properly set up for performance
- [ ] Foreign key constraints are established for data integrity

## Technical Requirements
- Use PostgreSQL as the primary database
- Implement proper database normalization
- Include audit fields (created_at, updated_at, deleted_at for soft deletes)
- Set up database connection pooling
- Create database backup and recovery procedures

## Definition of Done
- Database schema is designed and documented
- Migration scripts are created and tested
- Database can be set up from scratch using migrations
- All tables have proper indexes and constraints
- Database performance is optimized for expected load
