# TASK-01-MARKETPLACE-CRAWLER-SETUP: Setup Marketplace Crawler Infrastructure

## Task Description
Set up the basic infrastructure and architecture for the marketplace crawler system.

## Subtasks
1. **Environment Setup**
   - Set up development environment for web scraping
   - Install required libraries (scrapy, selenium, requests, etc.)
   - Configure database for storing crawled data
   - Set up Redis for task queuing and rate limiting

2. **Crawler Framework**
   - Implement base crawler class with common functionality
   - Create marketplace-specific crawler implementations
   - Implement configurable crawling rules system
   - Add support for different data formats (JSON, HTML, XML)

3. **Anti-Bot Measures**
   - Implement user agent rotation
   - Add proxy support for IP rotation
   - Implement CAPTCHA solving integration
   - Add delay and rate limiting mechanisms

4. **Data Storage**
   - Design staging database schema for raw crawled data
   - Implement data persistence layer
   - Add data compression for efficient storage
   - Create data retention policies

## Technical Requirements
- Use Go with appropriate scraping libraries
- Implement concurrent crawling with worker pools
- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Include error handling and retry mechanisms
- Support for both API and web scraping approaches

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Crawler infrastructure is set up and functional
- [ ] At least 3 marketplace crawlers are implemented
- [ ] Anti-bot measures are working effectively
- [ ] Data storage and retrieval works correctly
- [ ] System can handle concurrent crawling operations
- [ ] Logging and monitoring provide adequate visibility

## Estimated Time: 5-8 days
