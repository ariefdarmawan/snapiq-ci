# TASK-02-PRODUCT-CURATION-ALGORITHM: Implement Product Curation Algorithm

## Task Description
Develop and implement the product curation algorithm that can identify trending and best-selling products based on multiple criteria.

## Subtasks
1. **Data Analysis Framework**
   - Analyze marketplace data structure and patterns
   - Identify key metrics for product popularity
   - Create statistical models for trend analysis
   - Implement data aggregation and preprocessing

2. **Scoring Algorithm**
   - Design multi-criteria scoring system
   - Implement weighted scoring algorithm
   - Add configurable weights for different criteria
   - Create normalization functions for different metrics

3. **Filtering System**
   - Implement category-based filtering
   - Add location-based filtering capabilities
   - Create price range filtering
   - Add time-based filtering (new vs established products)

4. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - Implement trend prediction model
   - Add recommendation engine for product selection
   - Create feedback loop for algorithm improvement
   - Implement A/B testing framework for algorithm variants

## Technical Requirements
