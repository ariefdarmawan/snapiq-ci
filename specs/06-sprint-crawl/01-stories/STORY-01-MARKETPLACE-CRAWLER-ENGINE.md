# STORY-01-MARKETPLACE-CRAWLER-ENGINE: Web Scraping Engine for Marketplace Data

## User Story
As a system administrator, I want a web scraping engine that can crawl data from various online marketplaces so that I can automatically collect product information for curation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The system can connect to multiple marketplace APIs and websites (Tokopedia, Shopee, Bukalapak, etc.)
- [ ] The crawler can handle different data formats (JSON, HTML, XML)
- [ ] The system includes rate limiting and respectful crawling practices
- [ ] The crawler can handle anti-bot measures and CAPTCHA challenges
- [ ] The system logs all crawling activities and errors
- [ ] The crawler supports parallel processing for multiple sources
- [ ] The system can handle marketplace-specific authentication if required

## Technical Requirements
- Implement configurable crawling rules for different marketplaces
- Use proper user agents and headers to avoid blocking
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Store raw crawled data in a staging database
- Support for both real-time and batch crawling modes

## Definition of Done
- Web scraping engine is implemented and tested
- Configuration system for different marketplaces is in place
- Logging and monitoring system is functional
- Error handling and retry mechanisms are working
- Performance testing shows acceptable crawling speed
